# Max Konzerowsky

Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name's Max, and I'm a Computer Science major at Dartmouth College and a coxswain on our __Men's Lightweight Rowing Team__. 
What excites me most about programming is that you're given all the tools necessary to solve real-world problems, but how you choose to use those tools is up to you. 
Outside of the classroom and boathouse, I'm a computational research intern at the __National Renewable Energy Labratory__ and also like to work on independent projects.
