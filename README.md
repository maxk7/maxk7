About me: My name is Max, and I'm a Computer Science major at Dartmouth College and a coxswain on our Men's Lightweight Rowing Team. What excites me most about programming is that you're given all the tools necessary to solve real-world problems, but how you choose to use those tools is up to you. Outside of the classroom and boathouse, I am a computational research intern at the National Renewable Energy Labratory and also like to work on independent projects.
